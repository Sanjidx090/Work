"The Black Crown has returned," spoke Lord Dain. "The shadow stirs in the ruins of Mornhollow. If we do not act now, the old war shall rise again."

Among them stood a young knight, Elric son of Thrain, barely of age but bearing the sword of his forefathers. "If the crown is to be stopped, we must find the lost heir of Andor," he declared.

The council murmured. The heir was but a legend, a name whispered in old songs. Yet, the shadows of Mornhollow thickened, and the time for doubt was past. And so Elric, with a band of warriors, set forth on a quest that would take them beyond the known world.
