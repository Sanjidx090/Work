Once in a quiet valley, where the hills rolled gently and the rivers sang soft melodies, there lived a small folk known as the Hillers. They had round doors, warm fires, and the finest tea in all the lands. Young Bramble Goodroot, a Hiller of no particular renown, was content with his books and biscuits—until the day a hooded stranger arrived.

"You have been chosen for a journey, Bramble," said the stranger, pulling from his cloak a map of an ancient path long forgotten. "The silver lantern of Eldryn has been lost for a hundred years, and you are the only one who can find it."

Bramble gulped. "Me? But I have never left the valley!"

"Then it is time you did," the stranger replied. And so, with much hesitation, Bramble packed his satchel, bid farewell to his peaceful home, and set off on an adventure he never sought—but one that would change the fate of his people forever.
